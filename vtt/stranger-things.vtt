00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.480
On Halloween night, Will saw, a sort of
shadow.

2
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Maybe all this

3
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.800
is happening for a reason.

4
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.120
These are not nightmares.

5
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.440
It's happening.

6
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.520
And it all leads back

7
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.720
to here.

8
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.320
This thing, you said it was all

9
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.120
in his head! And what

10
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.000
have you done? Nothing.

11
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.200
What is wrong with my boy! I don't
understand.

12
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Eleven would, she always

13
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.860
did.

14
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.040
It's like it's reaching into Hawkins.

15
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.560
If anyone

16
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.760
knows how to destroy this thing, it's
Will.

17
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.880
Don't

18
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.480
you think it's weird, how we always

19
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.680
seem to hang out when the world is about
to end.

20
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.960
It's not like it was before, its grown.

21
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.240
It's judgement day, which

22
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.440
is why we need as much help as we can
get.

23
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.680
Is anyone there! ANYONE! You should go
now, it's almost here.

24
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.640
RUN! You still

25
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.440
have that bat? Bat? What bat? The one
with the nails.
