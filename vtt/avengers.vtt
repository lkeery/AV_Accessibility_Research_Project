1
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.280
You were made to be ruled.

2
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.480
In the

3
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.960
end.

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.160
It will

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.560
be every man for himself.

6
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.560
What do we do? We get ready.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.400
There was an idea.

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.960
To bring together a

9
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.800
group of remarkable people.

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.600
So when we needed them.

11
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.800
They could fight the battles, but we
never could.

12
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.600
What are you prepared

13
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.800
to do?

14
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.640
No offense, but I don't play well with
others.

15
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.680
Big man in a suit armor.
Take that away.

16
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.400
What are you, a genius?

17
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Billionaire playboy philanthropist.

18
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.040
If we can't protect the earth,

19
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.240
you can be damn sure we'll avenge it.

20
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.640
Dr.

21
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.200
Bennett, your work is unparalleled, and
I'm a huge

22
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400
fan of the way you lose control and turn
into an enormous green rage monster.

23
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.440
Thanks.
